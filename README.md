In this project the prompt was the following:

Consider a scenario where you've been hired by NASA to build an internal tool. Their engineers would like a way to calculate the weight of their various instruments on different planets in our solar system.

This information will be used by the engineers to plan out how much equipment can be transported while still being able to depart the destination planet.


I created an input for the users weight and a selector for the planet they wanted to see how much they weighed on. When you click the calculate weight button it returned what the user's weight would be on the planet they had selected.
